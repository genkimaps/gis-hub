      <h2>Known Issues</h2>
      <p>This section summarizes known issues on the GIS Hub
        that affect the end-user experience, and where available,
        a workaround. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> Adding multiple Species Codes to a dataset only lets
        you select the first species code.  Also, species codes after
        29V - NASSARIUS FOSSATUS do not work.
        <br>
        <b>Workaround:</b>  Include a file called species_codes.csv, with
        a list of all your codes, inside the zipped data upload.
        See the section on Species Codes for a detailed description
        of the file format. This does not solve the bug with codes
        after 29V not being saved, but as long as the species codes are
        saved in the csv file, the list of codes can be refreshed
        when this bug is fixed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> The Download ZIP button shows a disclaimer,
        but when you click Accept, nothing happens.
        <br>
        <b>Workaround:</b> under Data and Resources, identify the
        data package you wish to download.  Click the Details button,
        click the Download button near the top-right.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> Non-science keywords are not restricted to
        the list of keywords from the Government of Canada
        <a href="http://canada.multites.net/cst/index.htm" target="_blank">Core
        Subject Thesaurus</a>.
        The autocomplete displays only previously-entered keywords,
        instead of the list from the GoC Thesaurus.  Additionally,
        it does not prevent you from entering a keyword that does
        not exist in the GoC Thesaurus.
        <br>
        <b>Workaround:</b> Please be careful when entering keywords.
        Look up the keywords on the thesaurus website first.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The GIS Hub system is live and ready for users to publish data.
        This documentation page contains guidelines for preparing
        your data and metadata for publishing on the system.  Please note
        that some of these guidelines may change as the system is improved. </p>

      <p>Keep in mind that these are <i>guidelines</i> and not strict rules.
        We prefer that staff start using the system as soon as possible,
        so that any unforeseen issues can be resolved before full release.
        Even if your data does not meet all of the requirements listed here,
        you may prepare it for publishing anyway, with the understanding
        that the published data and/or metadata can easily be updated in the future.  </p>

      <h2>Metadata Overview</h2>
      <p>The Pacific Science metadata working group has created a comprehensive
        metadata standard with relevant fields for Science.  In addition to
        ]the science metadata, the standard includes general-purpose
        geospatial metadata.  The general metadata is required for all spatial
        data published on the Federal Geospatial Portal (FGP) and/or Open Data.
        Even if your data is not a candidate for publishing on FGP or Open Data,
        the general metadata is required since it provides important information
        for staff downloading and using the data.  </p>
      <p>The metadata standard is divided into several modules, each of which
        contains a number of metadata fields.  The same modules are shown on
        the GIS Hub on the metadata forms, when creating a new dataset.
        We suggest that you write your metadata in a document and copy and
        paste the content into the metadata system, when both the data and
        metadata are ready. </p>
      <p>During the data upload process, your data is extracted automatically
        by the server and properties such as projection and spatial extents
        are recorded.  Metadata fields that are extracted automatically are
        not shown in the metadata modules belowâ€”only the fields that require
        manual input in the metadata entry system are shown.</p>
      <p>All fields in each metadata module are required unless marked as
        optional.</p>

      <h2>Metadata Modules</h2>
      <h3>Basic Information</h3>
      <p>This section is a set of basic information required for all metadata entries.
        This information is displayed near the top of the page when viewing metadata.</p>
      <p>The metadata standard requires contact information for organizations
        responsible for various aspects of the data.  Two sets of contact
        information are required: data creator (included in the Basic Information
        section) and program manager. </p>

          <td>Set to Public when all required metadata fields have been
            entered and the data is ready to be published.  Note that
            setting Public does not make the dataset visible to all users,
            nor to Google; it only means that the dataset is published and
            will appear in search results on the GIS Hub.  Access permissions
            for datasets (who is allowed to download / view) are set elsewhere.
            <br><br>
            Set this to Private if you do not yet have all the information
            you need to complete the required metadata fields.   When set to
            Private, you can save the metadata form, even if it is incomplete,
            and come back to it later.  Your Private (i.e., incomplete or
            unpublished) datasets can be viewed by clicking your username
            at the top right and looking for entries marked Draft.
            You may also wish to bookmark the URL of the dataset,
            which will not change.
