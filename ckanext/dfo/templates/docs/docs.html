      <h2>Known Issues</h2>
      <p>This section summarizes known issues on the GIS Hub
        that affect the end-user experience, and where available,
        a workaround. </p>
      <p>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Problem:</span> Adding multiple Species Codes to a dataset only lets
        you select the first species code.  Also, species codes after
        29V - NASSARIUS FOSSATUS do not work.
        <br>
        <span class="font-weight-bold">Workaround:</span>  Include a file called species_codes.csv, with
        a list of all your codes, inside the zipped data upload.
        See the section on Species Codes for a detailed description
        of the file format. This does not solve the bug with codes
        after 29V not being saved, but as long as the species codes are
        saved in the csv file, the list of codes can be refreshed
        when this bug is fixed.
